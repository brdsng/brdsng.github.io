# Your privacy

The developers of Birdsong take your privacy very seriously. All personal information is collected by fair and lawful means, with your full knowledge and consent. Your data will never be shared with or sold to third-parties entities under any circumstance, except when required by law.

Birdsong collects information about you or members of guilds you are associated with to support proper functionality. The following information may be collected:

- Your Discord user ID (for connecting you to issued punishments, and counting points)
- Discord guild IDs (when you join a server using Birdsong, or if you are a server owner)
- Message IDs, channel IDs, and links for messages you send (for the purpose of moderator logs)
- Text inputs by the user (for configuration of guild settings)

We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we do collect, we'll protect using commercially reasonable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

Requests for data removal may be honored on a limited basis, however, "mod-log" entries related to your user account will remain accessible by moderators in guilds where you have received punishments.

Further inquiries about Birdsong's privacy practices may be directed to `miike#3459`. Additional relevant information can be found in the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
