# Welcome to Birdsong

Birdsong is a modern Discord modbot for ease, speed, and control in modding. We use a point-based infraction system ([recommended by Discord](https://discord.com/moderation/1500000176081-203-Developing-Server-Rules#title-4)) that is lauded for ease of use and configuration by server owners across the platform.
