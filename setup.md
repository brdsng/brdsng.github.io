# Quick Setup Guide

Want to get Birdsong set up in your server quick? Follow the two-step guide below and you'll be on your way.

## Step 1: Invite the bot

[Click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=817513543049674773&permissions=403041382&scope=bot) to invite Birdsong to your server. You'll need to be logged into Discord. Select your server, and then authorize the bot.

**IMPORTANT:** It is highly recommended that you do not change the default permissions preset; Birdsong may not function properly without certain permissions!

## Step 2: Configure some settings

To configure Birdsong's settings in your guild, you will need to use the `>>set` command. This command can only be used by the server owner.

- **`>>set mod_role <role>`:** Set which role you'd like to have moderator permissions. Users with moderator permissions can issue punishments and read modlogs. Until you set this setting, only the owner can run mod-level commands. [Read more about moderator permissions.](/docs#access-level-all)
- **`>>set mute_role <role>`:** When a user gets muted, Birdsong will apply this role to them. IMPORTANT: If you don't have this set up, Birdsong will not be able to mute users in your server!
- `>>set log_channel <channel>`: When a guild moderator issues a punishment, Birdsong will send a short blurb about the punishment to this channel. This can be helpful for keeping track of moderator actions.
- `>>set appeal_link <link>`: Set a link which users will be directed to appeal if they receive a permanent ban. If you're a server who wants to give users a second chance, this option is for you.

## Step 3: Learn how to punish

Birdsong was created as an infraction point system to punish users. The syntax for giving infraction points is:

```
>>point <user> <points> <reason?>
```

In the command, `<user>` can be a user mention or ID, and `<reason>` is optional (but recommended). A complete example would be:

```
>>point @miike 1 spamming in #general
```

Once you run this command, the user will be given points and punished based on their prior point value.

## All done! ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations! You've finished setting up Birdsong in your server, and you know how to give punishments to users. It is recommended that you [read the commands docs](/docs) to be informed of all other helpful moderation commands we support.
