# Global Punishment Key

For sake of use, Birdsong includes a global punishment key. This means that when a user is given a positive amount of points, their new point total will determine their punishment according to the key found below.

In the future, Birdsong will support custom punishment keys. Stay tuned!

## The Key:

```
0 points:  none (n/a)
1 point:   warning
2 points:  15 minute mute
3 points:  30 minute mute
4 points:  45 minute mute
5 points:  60 minute mute
6 points:  12 hour ban
7 points:  1 day ban
8 points:  1 day ban
9 points:  3 day ban
10 points: 3 day ban
11 points: 1 week ban
