# Why use Birdsong?

You may be asking yourself: "There's plenty of mod bots out there; why should I use Birdsong?"

## <span class='header-emoji'>‚úîÔ∏è</span> You want **ease of use**

You've tried other mod bots, and they're cluttered with pages of documentation and things you don't really need. You find it annoying to check the logs *every time* someone breaks the rules.

*etc...*

## <span class='header-emoji'>‚è≥</span> You want **speed**

You don't like switching back and forth between channels, checking logs, checking with your team before punishing your users. You've tried other mod bots, and they're *clunky and slow!*

*etc...*

## <span class='header-emoji'>üî®</span> You want **control**

You're tired of your users saying *"you're not being fair!"* and disregarding your rules. You're done with users who are constantly on the line of being banned. You want control over your users, in a simple way.

*etc...*
